On the left side of the screen are the player's and computer's decks of cards. The number represents how many cards are currently in each deck. To play a round, click "Play!". The player with the higher card wins the round, along with both of the cards. If there is a tie, on the right side of the window each player will place down 4 cards and a 5th card will be drawn to break the tie. The winner of that round gets all the cards on the table. Once the game is complete, you can select "New Game" to play again. You can also select "Simulate", to simulate a full game.

Upon opening Battleship, you are greeted with two battleship boards. On the left is the CPU's board. Here you will attempt to make guesses as to where the CPU's ships are located. On the right is your board, here you will place your ships and the CPU will try to guess where they are. To play, you first must place your ships. You can either press "Auto Ship Place" to have all your ships placed for you, or you can place each one individually. You must place 1 Aircraft Carrier, 2 Battleships, 2 Destroyers, and 1 Submarine in normal mode, and in 'Single Submarine' mode you place 1 Submarine. You can change modes by clicking the radio buttons next to 'Game Mode'. To place your ships, first select the ship type from the dropdown menu. Then, select the tile you want to start your ship at. A few options will show up around the tile depending on the ship's size, then choose the direction you would like to place your ship in. If you want to change ship location, select the center button (marked as C). Once all your ships are placed, you can select "Start Game!" to start the game. Upon starting the game, you can choose any box on the CPU board to make a guess. If you hit a ship, a "H" with a yellow background will appear. If you sink a ship, all the boxes that contain the ship will turn red. Beneath each board you can see how many ships each player has remaining on the board. Clicking "Reset" at any time will reset the game.

Clicking "Roll" when it is your turn will roll each dice on the board. You can click any individual dice to place it into a "hold" state, where once you roll the dice again it will not be rolled. On the right side are the player's point sections. When you place dice into the hold, each possible combination that you can use will have a check box next to it. To place the dice into that section and get points, click the box and click the "Confirm" button. This will give the turn to the CPU. Click "CPU Turn" and "Next" to have the CPU run through its options. Click "Your Turn" to run your next turn. Once the game is complete, you can click either "Reset" button to reset the game. You can also click the "Reset" button at the bottom at any time to reset the game.
## Minesweeper

To start a game of minesweeper, select your difficulty on the bottom left. Click "Start Game" once you have selected the difficulty you want to play. Easy is a 8x8 board with 10 mines, Medium is a 16x16 board with 40 mines, and Hard is a 30x16 board with 99 mines. Select "Start Game" to spawn the board, and click a individual button to start. Right clicking a button will mark the space as a mine, where left clicking will reveal the value of the space. Left clicking on a bomb tile will cause the mine to explode, ending the game. To reset the game, click the "Reset" button.
## Checkers

To start a game of checkers, select the start button. You play as the black checkers, and make the first move. Clicking on a checker will highlight all possible moves for that checker. Clicking on a highlighted space will move the checker to that position. If you take a checker, this checker will be removed from the board. If the CPU takes your checker, it will also be removed from the board. The number of checkers remaining on the board for each player is shown on the right side of the checker board. Clicking "Make Move for Me" will automatically move one of your pieces for you based on the CPU's algorithm. Clicking "Reset" will reset the game board at any time.
## Super Tic-Tac-Toe

Super Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe) consists of one large Tic-Tac-Toe game, however in each square of the large game exists one smaller game of Tic-Tac-Toe. To claim a square in the large game, you must win the small game in that square. Selecting a space in a small game dictates which game the next player must play in (ex. choosing the top right square forces the next player to play in the top right game). If a square is chosen in which the game in that section is complete, the next player can choose any small game to play in. To reset the game at any time, click the 'Reset' button.
## Word Guess

Word Guess (which is definitely NOT Wordle) is a word guessing game, where you have 5 changes to guess a 4, 5, or 6 letter word. To Start, select the word size you would like to guess (or random to choose for you). Then, click 'Start'. Upon starting Word Guess, you can start typing a guess. Once you have entered your guess, press the enter key to submit your guess. If a letter you typed in turns green, it is in the correct spot. If it turns yellow, then this letter exists in the word but is not in the correct spot. If the square changes to a different gray, then the letter does not appear in the word. Clicking "Reset" at any time will choose another word and reset the game. To change word size, select the word size you would like to guess next at the bottom and click 'Reset'.
