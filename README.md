# Game Instructions
## Tic Tac Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe board is represented by 9 buttons in the center of the screen. To play, select your AI difficulty on the right, then choose one of the middle buttons to make your first move.
Once the game is complete, the score will be tallied on the right side. Select "New Game" to start another game against the AI, or select "Reset Score" to reset the score.
## War
On the left side of the screen are the player's and computer's decks of cards. The number represents how many cards are currently in each deck. To play a round, click "Play!". The player with the higher card wins the round, along with both of the cards. If there is a tie, on the right side of the window each player will place down 4 cards and a 5th card will be drawn to break the tie. The winner of that round gets all the cards on the table. Once the game is complete, you can select "New Game" to play again. You can also select "Simulate", to simulate a full round.
NOTE: Upon opening War and selecting "New Game", the program is randomly dealing out all cards. This takes a few seconds.
## Battleship
Upon opening Battleship, you are greeted with two battleship boards. On the left is the CPU's board. Here you will attempt to make guesses as to where the CPU's ships are located. On the right is your board, here you will place your ships and the CPU will try to guess where they are. First, you must place your ships. You can either press "Auto Ship Place" to have the ships placed for you, or you can place each one individually. You must place 1 Aircraft Carrier, 2 Battleships, 2 Destroyers, and 1 Submarine. To place, enter the start and end coordinates of the ship into the text box, and select "Place Ship!". Once all ships have been placed, select "Start Game" to start. You can guess one spot at a time by entering in your desired coordinates and selecting "Make Guess". A message will show in the middle of the screen telling you if you hit a ship, and it will also show up on the board as a "H". If there is an "O", that means you missed. Once the game is complete, you can click "Reset" to play again.
## Yahtzee
Clicking "Roll" when it is your turn will roll each dice on the board. You can click any individual dice to place it into a "hold" state, where once you roll the dice again it will not be rolled. On the right side are the player's point sections. When you place dice into the hold, each possible combination that you can use will have a check box next to it. To place the dice into that section and get points, click the box and click the "Confirm" button. This will give the turn to the CPU. Click "CPU Turn" and "Next" to have the CPU run through its options. Click "Your Turn" to run your next turn. Once the game is complete, you can click either "Reset" button to reset the game. You can also click the "Reset" button at the bottom at any time to reset the game.
